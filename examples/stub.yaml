# CV_schemes contains an 88x100 matrix (items by schemes) where each column is
# a random permutation of the numbers 1--22. Rows corresponding to the same
# number belong to the same cross-validation block under that scheme. These
# schemes are pre-specified so that it is possible to perfectly re-create
# results, and also makes it easy to hold out a cv block to use as an
# evaluation set for a final model which uses parameters tuned with knowledge
# of only the other 21 blocks.
